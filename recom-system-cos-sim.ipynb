In this case each movie can be interpreted as a vector, and the dimensions of the vectors are the features present for the movies. The formula for calculating the cosine similarity can be seen here:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/HDkh3Gg/cos.png)\n\nThis formula can be interpreted in our case the following way: each of the movies have a feature vector like (f1, f2, ..., fn) with n features (the features are genres and the calculated relevant tags for ex. oscar-winner), and if the fm feature is true for the movie, in m-th place 1 will be in the vector, otherwise 0.
