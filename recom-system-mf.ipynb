This method works by creating an M matrix of size U*I, where U is the number of users, and I is the number of items, in our case movies, and in the matrix, the M[i,j] element is the rating given to the j-th movie by the i-th user. \n\nThe matrix factorization method creates two matrixes, one is named as User Feature Vector (M1) with size of U*K, and an Item Feature Vector (M2) with the size of I*K, in a way, that values in Mnew = M1*M2 should differ as less as possible from the original M. \n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Zhm1NMlmVywn0G18w3exog.png)\n\nThe recommendation for a user is done returning movies with the highest value from the Mnew, which were empty in the original matrix.\n\nThe matrix factorization will be presented with 2 different methods:\n* Singular value decomposition\n* Kernelized matrix factorization\n\nThe main difference between the two methods, is that the kernelized matrix factorization can do online learning, so if new ratings or new users come, the whole matrix factorization process doesn't have to be \nrecalculated.\n\nIn both of the case the validation metric used is the root mean squared error, which can be calculated in the following way: we take the squared error of each of the predictions, we sum these, and divide it by the number of predictions, and finally the square root of this is calculated.
